        <p class="lead2">World Champion Taekwondo Academy is, by far, one of the most important aspects of our child’s life. Grandmaster Ryu
          has created an atmosphere of inspiration both physically and mentally for all the students. I watched my child
          transform physically from being timid and barely able to touch his toes to now kicking above his head and looking
          forward to his weekly sparring class. His confidence at school has escalated greatly as a result of this program
          as well. I’ve been teaching high school for twelve years, and I also am inspired by the work at the academy. Master
          Pae and Master Ryu make me want to be a better teacher, as I watch them every week connect with kids and adults,
          motivating them, pushing them, and loving them with individual attention and never a generic, one-size-fits-all
          approach. And that is the final, and possibly most important aspect of this experience—they have fostered a family
          out of all the participants. Our kids are close. The parents and adults come together as friends. I truly believe
          in this program and everything they have nurtured and created more than most things in this world. Our son has
          tried many activities from baseball to soccer to gymnastics, but World Champion TKD has and will remain the one
          constant in his life because he loves every minute of the experience and the strict and loving care of Grandmaster
          Ryu. This is the elite program for children and adults alike who are ready to introduce a positive change in their
          lives.

          </h2>
          <p class="lead2">Our family has benefited in so many ways by enrolling our son in classes at World Champion Taekwondo Academy. Not
            only from the martial arts standpoint, but from the lifelong friendships that have developed...not only for my
            son, but myself and husband as well. Classes are hard, but fun....the kids don't even realize how hard they are
            actually working!! I realize that fun isn’t the only benefit Tyler has received at WCTA. He has learned and practiced
            safety skills for many different real life situations. He has learned self defense and appropriate times to use
            these skills. He is reminded to show respect, to set an example, and to be honest at all times. Taekwondo became
            a life skill he has worked hard to acquire and could be proud of. He has spent the last 4+ years learning the
            value of commitment and follow through. All the while, his confidence increased. I appreciate and respect Grand
            Master Ryu and Master Pae and their commitment to the sport they love so much. I am grateful for all that my
            son has learned and benefited through WCTA, and “fun” was just a part of it!"</p>
